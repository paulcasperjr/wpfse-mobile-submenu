# WP FSE Mobile Submenu

WP FSE Mobile Submenu enhances the WordPress Full Site Editing (FSE) experience by adding Vanilla JS and CSS to enable dropdown functionality for submenu items in the mobile navigation block.

## Features:
- ✅ Enables dropdowns for submenu items in mobile navigation
- ✅ Uses lightweight Vanilla JavaScript and CSS
- ✅ Works out of the box with default FSE navigation structure
- ✅ Easily customizable for multiple navigation instances

## Installation & Setup

By default, the first navigation modal in FSE is `#modal-1-content`, so the plugin should work immediately. However, if you're using multiple navigation blocks or have deleted and re-added a menu, you may need to update the CSS file to target the correct modal ID (e.g., `#modal-2-content`, `#modal-3-content`).
