# wpfse-mobile-submenu
Adds some Vanilla JS and CSS to the mobile navigation in the Wordpress navigation block to allow dropdowns for submenu.

Some things to note:
You may need to adjust the ID on the navigation modal in the CSS file. 

By default, the first navigation you use in FSE is #modal-1-content, so in most cases it should work out of the box.
If you use multiple navigations (or created one and then deleted it and added another) you will need to target the one you want to use. ex. #modal-2-content, #modal-3-content etc.

Hope this helps!
